This is a proposal for a constructive open source system.

The system as it is already functions as a toy. My guess is it can be used in art classes as it is or with the goal of developing other and new modules. I am quite sure it can be also adapted for the use in biology classes or as a protein models creator or something.

Combining its modules, the system allows the creation of both stable and rigid shapes, but its most important feature is the possibility of creating dynamic structures, that is, capable of changing its shape without the parts being disconnected. This is possible due to the fitting system made up of tubes and pins. Each part connects with others through the presence of at least one tube or pin.

The BEST filament for this project appears strongly to be the PETG.

PETG basic configs are:

I printed with a 0.3 layer and 20% infill

I used a 45% limit for support and 3% of support density and also a 8 brim for better fixing the pieces in the plate

I used a 30mm/s

Also 230ยบ nozzle and 50ยบ the plate (i use a  weak hairspray to adhere the pieces to the hotbed.)

 

 

I have also printed in ABS with 0.3mm layer and a 15% infill and a 6% support density and it works well. Better quality (layer and infill) may lead to better results but it works fine with this minimal settings, it is aceptable but I found PETG better..
